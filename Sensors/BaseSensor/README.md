## Base Sensor

A C# project that serves as a base class for all C# sensor modules that communicate with hardware sensors. All the C# sensor modules are ancestors of BaseSensor instead of usual Form classes. The [ControlledPTT.App](../../App) references the BaseSensor in order to create the specific sensor modules and communicate with them.

Reference to DLL generated by this project must be included in all of these C# programs in order to visualize temperature data.
